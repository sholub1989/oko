# Project Instructions

## Git Rules
- NEVER run `git add`, `git commit`, `git push`, or any git write operations unless the user explicitly asks
- Do not stage files, create commits, or push to remote on your own
- NEVER add Co-Authored-By or any attribution to commits or PRs

## Workflow Orchestration

### 1. Plan Node Default
- Enter plan mode for ANY non-trivial task (3+ steps or architectural decisions)
- If something goes sideways,
STOP and re plan immediately - don't keep pushing
- Use plan mode for verification steps, not just building
- Write detailed specs upfront to reduce ambiguity
- 
### 2. Subagent Strategy
Use subagents liberally to keep main context window clean
Offload research, exploration, and parallel analysis to subagents
- For complex problems,
throw more compute at it via subagents
- One tack per subagent for focused
- 
### 3. Self-Improvement Loop
- After ANY correction from the user: update 'tasks/lessons.md"
with the pattern
- Write rules for yourself that prevent the same mistake
- Ruthlessly iterate on these lessons until mistake rate drops
- Review lessons at session start for relevant project
- 
### 4. Verification Before Done
Never mark a task complete without proving it works
- Diff behavior between main and your changes when relevant
- Ask yourself: "Would a staff engineer approve this?"
- Run tests, check logs, demonstrate correctness
- 
### 5. Demand Elegance (Balanced)
For non-trivial changes: pause and ask "is there a more elegant way?"
- If a fix feels hacky: "Knowing everything I know now, implement the elegant solution"
- Skip this for simple, obvious fixes - don't over-engineer
- Challenge your own work before presenting it
- 
## 6. Autonomous Bug Fizing
When
given a bug report: just fix it. Don't ask for hand-holding
Point at logs, errors, failing tests - then resolve them
- Zero context switching required from the user
- Go fix failing CI tests without being told how
- 
## Task Management
**Plan First**: Write plan to 'tasks/todo.md' with checkable items
**Verify Plan**: Check in before starting implementation
**Track Progress**: Mark items complete as you go
**Explain Changes**: High-level summary at each step
**Document Results**: Add review section to 'tasks/todo.md"
**Capture Lessons**: Update "tasks/lessons.md"
after corrections

## Releasing
To cut a new release: `pnpm release <version>` (e.g. `pnpm release 0.5.0`).
This builds, audits the package for source leaks, bumps `package.json`, commits, tags, and pushes.
CI then automatically publishes to npm and creates a GitHub Release.

**Rules:**
- NEVER run `npm publish` manually — it is blocked locally and only CI can publish
- NEVER manually create tags or bump versions separately
- The version in `package.json` must match the tag at build time or the UI will show the wrong version
- The npm package name is `oko-sh` — published as closed-source (compiled JS only, no TypeScript source)
- npm publishing uses Trusted Publishing (OIDC) — no NPM_TOKEN needed, configured on npmjs.com per-package

## Core Principles
- **Simplicity First**: Make every change as simple as possible. Impact minimal code.
- **No Laziness**: Find root causes. No temporary fixes.
Senior developer standards.
- **Minimat Impact**: Changes should only touch what's necessary. Avoid introducing bugs.
